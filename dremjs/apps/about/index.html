    <p>Changelog:<br />
    Version 0.1.7b<br />
    +File Manager<br />
    +Notepad<br />
    +A right-click context menu<br />
    +Added new folders<br />
    &nbsp;+ /etc - Used for holding configuration files<br />
    &nbsp;+ /assets - Holds assets for use by DremJS<br />
    &nbsp;+ /assets/media/images - Holds specifically images<br />
    Spring cleaning<br />
    &nbsp;-Removed ambient music on all applications<br />
    &nbsp;-Removed 404 error screen (since it wasn't used anyway)<br />
    &nbsp;-Removed background.png (same reason as the above)<br />
    &nbsp;-Removed the old favicon<br />
    ~Made the terminal portable<br />
    ~General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.6b<br />
    +Widget support (see wiki for more information)<br />
    +Made clicking apps in the taskbar move applications to the front instead of minimizing.<br />
    +Cowsay (PHP and JS interfacing experiment)<br />
    +Changed the start menu to the Drem Logo<br />
    +Added a task manager (combined with Server Status application)<br />
    +Added a CPU/memory monitor (see wiki for more information)<br />
    ~Windows now have a shaded background<br />
    ~Fixed a bug in terminal where white-space is ignored by output().<br />
    ~Made terminal themes consistent (no more cookies)<br />
    ~General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.5b<br />
    +Readded the start menu<br />
	+A lite theme for the terminal, if that's your thing. You can toggle the theme with "settheme".<br />
    ~DremJS went on a strict diet and lost about 15MBs<br />
	~Changed DremJS's font to Calibri<br />
	~Overhauled the About application a lot.
	~General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.
	NOTE: Even though DremJS's font is Calibri, it does NOT mean that applications will automagically change to Calibri. Developers need to set their own font if they want a custom one.<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.4b<br />
    +Added ProcMan (Process Manager) to the terminal which allows you to list all processes or kill a process<br />
    +Added insmod (Install Module). It's on its first prototype so it's not able to do much.<br />
    ~Separated Terminal from Debug and made it accessible when not in Debug mode.<br />
    ~Updated Terminal image.<br />
    ~Probable a ton more changes that I forgot about before I went on a break<br />
    ~Updated to Agenda WM 0.1.0b, which adds some new features and tweaks including, but not limited to:<br />
        ~Made Agenda its own .js file<br />
        ~Moved the taskbar that was originally in DremJS into Agenda WM<br />
        +Added the ability to minimize and restore applications (hence the taskbar move)<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.3b<br />
    ~Updated to Agenda WM 0.0.4b, which adds some new features and tweaks including, but not limited to:<br />
        +A maximize button<br />
        +The ability to launch applications with a specific size.<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.2b (Hotfix 1)<br />
    ~Fixed a bug where multiple instances of the same app will have the same (supposed to be) unique identifier, which caused problems with closing and layering.<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.2b<br />
    This is a very important and large release for DremJS!<br />
    We are going to hard code the start menu to stay open at all times for a while until we care enough to reimpliment it better.<br />
    <!--  Maybe in 0.1.3b... -->
    <!--+++We're very glad to present a very basic application installation program! It only works on MiniWeb. I don't know if it will work on Apache servers or not.-->
    +++With the brand new Agenda WM, you can now multitask in DremJS!<br />
    +Added 'cmd_fm' command to terminal. CMD.FM is a free online radio service that looks like a computer terminal. <br /><br />
    Version 0.1.1b<br />
    +A terminal that is accessable from the Debug Menu. It's based off of <a href="https://codepen.io/AndrewBarfield/pen/qEqWMq?css-preprocessor=scss">Andrew Barfield's HTML5 Web Terminal</a>.<br />
    ~Some UI Tweaks<br />
    ~Bug Fixes<br />
    ~Made the shutdown function actually shut DremJS down<br /><br />
    Version 0.1.0b<br />
    +A taskbar<br />
    ++Home button moved to taskbar<br />
    ++About app is on taskbar for defaults. Because we are still working on the taskbar, documentation for adding or removing icons from the taskbar will not be released yet.<br />
    ~Some apps moved to the Marketplace to make DremJS smaller. The most important apps stay (About, DremJS Market, How to Install Apps, Report a Bug)<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.9-1a<br />
    +PVT Counter<br />
    ~Improved 404 screen that isn't an eye sore when you look at it in the dark<br />
    ~Bug Fixes<br />
    ~Made the GUI more centered and prettier<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.8-2a<br />
    =More WAV to MP3 fixes<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.8-1a<br />
    +A crash handler for 404 errors, should you have any.<br />
    +A little debug menu that can be found in the bug report application. Uncommenting it will enable it. At the moment, it is mostly useless.<br />
    ~A few minor patches<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.8a<br />
    +Shutdown animation<br />
    +Added icons for downloadable apps (apps in DremJS Market)<br />
    =Better Shop app (no iframe inside an iframe)<br />
    =Better way of getting downloads from DremJS Market (GitHub Releases)<br />
    =To prevent having to resize div in index-open.html, the start menu takes up the entire left hand side of the open page<br />
    =SO MANY MORE BUG FIXES!!!<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.7-3a<br />
    Removed the underlines and made all application links black in the start menu.<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.7-2a<br />
    Ironically, fixed a bug in the debug application which caused DremJS to open in a new tab when clicking "Go Back" by simply removing it. That's the home button's job anyway!<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.7-1a<br />
    ~Compatibility Update<br />
    Turned some .wav files into mp3 files for consistancy, and for better support for MiniWeb<br />
    Made the Debug application an application with the purpose of bug reporting<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.7a<br />
    ~Compatibility Update<br />
    +Changed iframes to use %'s rather than px. This will make the OS grow or shrink per the device's size. This was mainly added for smaller devices such as phones and tablets.<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.6-1a<br />
    +Open menu sound added<br />
    +Ambient music added in some built in applications<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.6a<br />
    This update was really only made for fun and to make the OS overall prettier.<br />
    ~The Market got moved to the actual DremJS-Market repository so that everyone has the same DremJS Market<br />
    +App Icons!<br />
    +Favicon!<br />
    +Shutdown Button<br />
    +Shutdown Sound<br />
    +Startup Sound<br />
    +A few more small tweaks to make the OS prettier<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.5a<br />
    +Whats that?! It's a gradualy improving app store!! You must download DremJS and host it or run it on your browser on your own PC to use it though.<br />
    Installation instructions are inside the zip that will download from it. Read it before you install!!!<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.4a<br />
    +Sam&Yoe Group: The Video Game<br />
      ~Music has some problems<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.3a<br />
    Now for some functionality.<br />
    +TinyMCE Text Editor<br />
    +Paint app<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.2a<br />
    +This version actually used javascript for the home button! Now DremJS really is DremJS! Seriously though, when installing web apps on this thing that don't have a home button, this button is a life saver.<br />
    -All built-in apps have gotten their home buttons removed due to the "master" home button.<br />
    -Test Apps Removed (from start menu)<br /><br />
    Version 0.0.1a<br />
    The first ever version. Doesn't even have JS yet, despite the name. Don't expect much.<br />
    Future ideas:<br />
    To be able to go back to the home screen easier, I will soon add a home button by loading apps using iframe instead.</p>
